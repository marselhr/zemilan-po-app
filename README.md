## Rules Repository ❗

- Whatever the smallest change, don't forget to give a clear commit message
- Always push to your own branch not to the ``main`` or ``development`` branch.
- When you feel your code task is complete, please make a pull request to the ``development`` branch.
- The project leader will review your code and merge it to the ``development`` branch.
- To avoid conflicts, don't forget to pull first from the ``development`` branch.
- Every time you pull from the development branch, run ``php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`` command to ensure the database structure changes are also applied to your local environment.
